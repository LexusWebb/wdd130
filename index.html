        <p>Hello Everyone, My name is Lexus Webb. I am originally from Portland Oregon, but I am currently living in Rexburg Idaho getting my degree in Public Health. I am currently working as an accountant, and could see myself doing similar work for the rest of my life. However, I still wanted to get my degree to not box myself in later on in life if I wanted to do something different. I am the oldest of three girls, and I have been married to my husband for almost four years now. I enjoy dancing and reading in my free time. I have been dancing for over 17 years, and have been classical trained in over ten different styles of dance. My huaband and I also love to travel, our most recent trip was to Costa Rica. For school, I love taking anthropology classes and classes geared toward understanding different cultures. I am super excited to take this class as an elective, and hope to learn some new skills that will be an asset to me in the future.</p>
